# `PyWidget`

Python Desktop Widget framework using Tkinter framework

## What is `PyWidget`?

Have you ever wanted to create a desktop widget, like the ones in Windows 7 and like Rainmeter widgets using Python Tkinter? Well, you're in luck. I had the same issue, and struggled to find a tool that would help me do this, but to no avail. So, I developed my own code to do this, and made it available to others for use.

## Usage

To use `PyWidget`, first decide whether you want to make a widget with a draggable title bar, or without one (still draggable). Navigate to the `src` folder and select the appropriate folder.

Now, simply download the Python file inside, and modify it as required.

There is one required dependency that needs to be installed for either of the options: PyInstaller, which can be installed with `pip install PyInstaller`.

## Known Bugs

A known bug is that the widget shows up annoyingly on the screen when a title-less window is opened. I am actively working towards resolving this bug. For any further bugs you have found, or if you want to suggest a feature, please use the "Issues" tab.
